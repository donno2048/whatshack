# whatshack
use this to create a fake whats-app web page

if someone uses the same machine as you are, you can run main.py

then, if he open the url you see when running the code he will see a fake whats-app registering page.

if he scan the code, **you** in the chrome browser opened in your PC will get access to his whats-app, therefore to his files
